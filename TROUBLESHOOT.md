## Issue: Mixpanel-swift 4.2.6 Incompatibility in Hybrid SDKs

**Problem:**
When integrating Mixpanel-swift 4.2.6 into a hybrid SDK (Flutter or React Native), the build fails due to compatibility issues.

**Solution:**
To resolve this issue, either:
- Upgrade to Mixpanel-swift 4.2.7
- Downgrade to Mixpanel-swift 4.2.5

Both versions have been tested and confirmed to work without issues.
